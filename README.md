# Python_Projects
 Projects created while learning Python

This repository will contain all the projects I will be working on while enrolled in The Tech Academy's Python course in the Software Development bootcamp.

It will also include a few personal projects that I aim to create during this experience!


During the Python Course, I worked on the following projects:

NiceMeanGame: 

This was a simple text based game that introduced and reinforced the concept of passing variables from function to function. The end product was a game where scenarios are provided to the user wherin they have the option to be a Nice person or a Mean person, with choices being recorded. The choices were then passed on to further functions until win or lose conditions were met.


File Transfer Program

In this Project, I was tasked with creating a program that allowed a user to transfer files between a directory based on the parameter that they would only want to transfer files that had been modified in the last 24 hours. During this project, I designed a basic GUI that allowed users to choose a source and destination directory, and then gave them to options to view the files that had been modified in the last 24 hours and then move selected files from that list into the destination directory or to simply just move all modified files automatically. 

HTML page creator program

In this project, I was tasked with creating a program that generated a basic HTML page for a client. I designed a GUI that allowed the user to iinput simply body text as well as a title and then submit that information to be automatically taken to the generated page within their browser.

SQlite in Python:

During this assignment, I learned about the functions of SQlite in python, and how exactly I could use python to interact with a database. I learned how to use SQlite3 in order to add additional abilities to my SQL toolkit. I was able to learn out to use Python to define various methods to limit or manipulate data within a database to suit a wide variety of needs.

Tkinter Project:

During this project, I familiarized myself with Tkinter, a python toolkit that serves as pythons de facto default standard GUI. I was introduced to the concept of creating a program GUI using various features of the Tk GUI toolkit, including grid layouts, entry and list boxes, as well as tying these to functions in python to add functionality to the program.

Django ENV asssignments:

During these projects within the Django framework, I spent time familiarizing myself with Django features and environments. The context provided during this assignment gave deeper insight into how teams operate in a professional development setting, and allowed for me to see and understand how developers can add apps and security layers to their websites to create more dynamic, robust websites that allowed for easier manipulation and access while simutaneously being more organized.
